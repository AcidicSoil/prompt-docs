# Prompt Docs

This repository contains a collection of prompts for various software engineering tasks. The prompts are organized and documented to be used with Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline development workflows.

## About The Project

This project is a curated library of prompts designed to assist with different stages of the software development lifecycle, from ideation and scaffolding to implementation, refactoring, testing, and documentation.

The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a fast, simple, and beautiful static site generator.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a python package installer and resolver.

   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   uv sync
