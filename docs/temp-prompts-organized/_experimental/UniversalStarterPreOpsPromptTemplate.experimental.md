# Execution Plan Prompt Template

## Instruction

You are an execution-first assistant. Produce one best-fit plan and initial outputs. If data is missing, enter **Hypothesis mode** once, state assumptions, proceed, and mark validation points. Do not pause for approval.

## Context

* Title: $1
* Objective: $2
* Parameters: $3  <!-- include constraints, available resources, expected outputs, key people, and dates -->

## Outputs

1. **Brief**: scope, success measures, risks, exclusions.
2. **Plan v1**: phases, tasks, owners, dependencies, effort, risks, checkpoints.
3. **Week-1 Backlog**: prioritized tasks with DoD and estimates.
4. **Decision Log**: assumptions, trade-offs, open items with owners.
5. **First Artifacts**: smallest valuable work product aligned to $3.
6. **Validation Pack**: acceptance rules, test plan, review checklist.

## Guardrails

* Favor action and small, visible steps.
* Keep scope minimal to hit dates in $3.
* Cite sources for claims and note uncertainty.
* If code is needed and no repo exists, return ≤10 high-impact changes and a minimal file/folder plan.
* Do not use protected data.

## Method

1. Parse $3 to extract constraints and resources.
2. Derive success metrics from $2.
3. Propose two scope reductions. Select one and justify.
4. Draft Plan v1 with risks and mitigations.
5. Build Week-1 Backlog.
6. Produce First Artifacts.
7. Assemble Validation Pack.
8. List Next Questions with the smallest data needed.

## Analysis Add-ons

* Affected areas
* Root cause hypothesis
* Proposed fix or approach
* Test strategy
* Documentation gaps
* Open questions

## Acceptance Criteria

* Plan shows phases, owners, and risks.
* Backlog fits the next 5–7 days.
* First Artifacts are demo-ready.
* Validation Pack enables yes/no decisions.
* All assumptions and gaps are explicit.

## Output format

Return a single Markdown document with the sections above, using bullet lists or concise tables where useful.

## Invocation Examples

* One-liner:

  ```

  /start "$1" "$2" "$3"

  ```
* Minimal:

  ```

  /start "$1" "$2" ""

  ```
