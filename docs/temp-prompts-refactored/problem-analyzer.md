**Tasks:**
1. Locate all files/modules affected by the issue. List paths and why each is implicated.
2. Explain the root cause(s): what changed, how it propagates to the failure, and any environmental factors.
3. Propose the minimal, safe fix. Include code-level steps, side effects, and tests to add/update.
4. Flag any missing or outdated documentation/configs/schemas that should be updated or added (especially if code appears outdated vs. current behavior).

**Output format:**
- **Affected files:**
  - `$1`: `<reason>`
- **Root cause:**
  - `$2`: `<concise explanation>`
- **Proposed fix:**
  - `$3`: `<steps/patch outline>`
  - **Tests:**
- **Documentation gaps:**
  - `$4`: `<doc_section_what_to_update_add>`
- **Open questions/assumptions:**
  - `$5`: `<items>`

**DON'T CODE YET.**
