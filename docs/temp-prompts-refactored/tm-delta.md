Purpose: Compare $1 against tasks.json and propose add/update/remove operations.

Steps:

$4. Map them to existing tasks by fuzzy match on title and keywords; detect gaps.

Propose: new tasks, updates to titles/descriptions/priority, and deprecations.

Output format:

- "# Delta Summary"
- Tables: adds | updates | removals.
- "## JSON Patch" with an ordered list of operations: add/replace/remove.
