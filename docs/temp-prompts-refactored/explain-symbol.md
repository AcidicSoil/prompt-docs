**Symbol Explanation Analysis**

<!-- $1 = Symbol to explain (e.g., "HttpClient") -->
<!-- $2 = Definition location (e.g., "src/network/httpClient.ts line 42") -->
<!-- $3 = Key usages (e.g., "services/userService.ts, hooks/useRequest.ts") -->

Output:
- Begin with a concise summary reiterating the goal: Explain where and how $1 is defined and used.
- Structure findings under clear subheadings for quick scanning.
- Document evidence: $2 (definition) and $3 (key usages).
- Note documentation gaps: [specify any missing documentation or context]
