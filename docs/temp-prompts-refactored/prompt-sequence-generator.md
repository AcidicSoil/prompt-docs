# Prompt: Generate Prompt Execution Sequence

**Purpose:** Given a high-level goal and a set of available prompts, generate the logical execution sequence required to accomplish that goal by chaining the prompts together.

---

### **Inputs**

*   **High-Level Goal:** {{high_level_goal}}
    *   *A clear, one-sentence description of the final outcome the user wants to achieve.*
    *   *Example: "Create and document a pull request for the currently staged changes."*

*   **Available Prompts:**
    ```
    {{available_prompts}}
    ```
    *   *A list of candidate prompt names (e.g., from the output of `rank-root-prompts`).*
    *   *Example: ['pr-desc.md', 'commit-msg.md', 'changed-files.md', 'review.md', 'release-notes.md']*

*   **Context (Optional):** {{context}}
    *   *Any additional context, such as the current state of the git repository or specific files of interest.*
    *   *Example: "The user has already staged files using `git add`."*

### **Instructions for the AI**

1.  **Analyze the Goal:** Deconstruct the `{{high_level_goal}}` into a series of logical steps required to get from the starting state to the final outcome.

2.  **Map Prompts to Steps:** For each logical step, identify the most suitable prompt from the `{{available_prompts}}` list that can perform that step.
    *   Consider the inputs and outputs of each prompt to determine dependencies. A prompt's input is often the output of a previous one.

3.  **Establish Order:** Arrange the selected prompts into a numbered sequence based on their dependencies. The sequence should represent a complete and logical workflow.

4.  **Identify Gaps:** If any necessary step in the workflow cannot be fulfilled by one of the available prompts, explicitly state what action or prompt is missing.

### **Required Output Format**

**Execution Sequence:**

1.  **`[prompt_name_1.md]`**: [Brief justification for why this prompt is first and what it accomplishes.]
2.  **`[prompt_name_2.md]`**: [Brief justification for why this prompt is second, and how it uses the output of the previous step.]
3.  ...

**Identified Gaps (if any):**

*   [Description of a missing step or prompt needed to complete the workflow.]
