# Prettier Adoption Migration Plan

Task: Given a `package.json` and file list, produce a structured report to plan a Prettier adoption or migration with minimal churn.

## Inputs

- Input files: `package.json`, filtered file list via `git ls-files '*.*' | sed -n '1,400p'`
- No explicit user input (command runs without arguments)

## Canonical taxonomy (exact strings)

- adoption
- migration
- planning

### Stage hints (for inference)

- analysis → when gathering context and proposing plans
- synthesis → when generating structured output

## Algorithm

1. Extract signals from the prompt:
   - Titles/headings: "Plan a Prettier adoption or migration"
   - Imperative verbs: gather, propose, synthesize, document
   - Explicit tags: "minimal churn", "rollout plan", "ignore patterns"

2. Determine the primary identifier:
   - From action and object → `prettier-adoption-plan`
   - Normalized to kebab-case, lowercase, length-capped (≤30), starts with letter.

3. Determine categories:
   - Explicit: adoption, migration, planning
   - Inferred from verbs: planning, proposing → mapped to canonical taxonomy
   - Final list: [adoption, migration, planning] — validated and de-duplicated

4. Determine lifecycle/stage (optional):
   - From stage hints: "analysis" → inferred as primary stage
   - Omitted if uncertain; here it is clear.

5. Determine dependencies (optional):
   - None explicitly stated; no prerequisites required beyond input files.
   - Empty list.

6. Determine provided artifacts (optional):
   - Structured report
   - Prioritized recommendations with rationale
   - Evidence of input usage

7. Compose summary:
   - One sentence: "Plan a Prettier adoption or migration with minimal churn to achieve actionable, evidence-backed rollout strategies."

8. Produce metadata in the requested format:
   - Identifier: prettier-adoption-plan
   - Categories: [adoption, migration, planning]
   - Stage: analysis
   - Dependencies: []
   - Artifacts: ["structured report", "prioritized recommendations", "evidence of input usage"]
   - Summary: "Plan a Prettier adoption or migration with minimal churn to achieve actionable, evidence-backed rollout strategies."

9. Reconcile if input already contains metadata:
   - No existing metadata; all values inferred.
   - All lists validated and within constraints.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- Emit exactly one document: metadata block, blank line, then original body unchanged.
- Limit distinct placeholders to ≤7.
- Output format must preserve the original prompt text.

## Validation

- Identifier matches normalized pattern → ✅
- Categories non-empty, drawn from canonical taxonomy (≤3) → ✅
- Stage is in allowed set: "analysis" → ✅
- Dependencies are id-shaped and empty → ✅
- Artifacts ≤3 → ✅
- Summary ≤120 chars → ✅ (148 chars — wait, exceeds limit)

Wait: Summary exceeds 120 characters. Let's revise.

Revised summary: "Plan a Prettier adoption or migration with minimal churn to achieve actionable rollout strategies." → 97 characters → ✅

Final summary: "Plan a Prettier adoption or migration with minimal churn to achieve actionable rollout strategies."

## Output format examples

- Identifier: prettier-adoption-plan
- Categories: [adoption, migration, planning]
- Stage: analysis
- Dependencies: []
- Artifacts: ["structured report", "prioritized recommendations", "evidence of input usage"]
- Summary: "Plan a Prettier adoption or migration with minimal churn to achieve actionable rollout strategies."
