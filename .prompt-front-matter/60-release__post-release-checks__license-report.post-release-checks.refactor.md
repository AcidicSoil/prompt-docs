# Post-Release License Check

## Metadata

- **identifier**: summarize-third-party-licenses
- **categories**:
  - license-analysis
  - risk-assessment
  - output-formatting
- **lifecycle_stage**: post-release
- **dependencies**:
  - license-checker
  - package-json
- **provided_artifacts**:
  - license-inventory
  - risk-flag-summary
- **summary**: Summarize third-party licenses and risk flags to achieve clear visibility into legal exposure and mitigation paths.

## Inputs

- CLI tool: `npx --yes license-checker`
- Target file: `package.json`

## Canonical taxonomy (exact strings)

- license-analysis
- risk-assessment
- output-formatting
- compliance-reporting
- dependency-scanning
- security-auditing
- post-release-checks

### Stage hints (for inference)

- pre-release → early development, dependency setup
- post-release → validation, legal review, risk mitigation
- production → ongoing monitoring

## Algorithm

1. Extract signals from $1
   - Titles/headings, imperative verbs, intent sentences, explicit tags, and dependency phrasing.

2. Determine the primary identifier
   - Prefer explicit input; otherwise infer from main action + object.
   - Normalize (lowercase, kebab-case, length-capped, starts with a letter).
   - De-duplicate.

3. Determine categories
   - Prefer explicit input; otherwise infer from verbs/headings vs $5.
   - Validate, sort deterministically, and de-dupe (≤3).

4. Determine lifecycle/stage (optional)
   - Prefer explicit input; otherwise map categories via $6.
   - Omit if uncertain.

5. Determine dependencies (optional)
   - Parse phrases implying order or prerequisites; keep id-shaped items (≤5).

6. Determine provided artifacts (optional)
   - Short list (≤3) of unlocked outputs.

7. Compose summary
   - One sentence (≤120 chars): “Do <verb> <object> to achieve <outcome>.”

8. Produce metadata in the requested format
   - Default to a human-readable serialization; honor any requested alternative.

9. Reconcile if input already contains metadata
   - Merge: explicit inputs > existing > inferred.
   - Validate lists; move unknowns to an extension field if needed.
   - Remove empty keys.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- Emit exactly one document: metadata, a single blank line, then $1.
- Limit distinct placeholders to ≤ 7.

## Validation

- Identifier matches a normalized id pattern.
- Categories non-empty and drawn from $5 (≤3).
- Stage, if present, is one of the allowed stages implied by $6.
- Dependencies, if present, are id-shaped (≤5).
- Provided artifacts, if present, are short and relevant (≤3).
- Summary ≤120 chars; punctuation coherent.
- Body text $1 is not altered.

## Output format examples

- identifier: analyze-deps
- categories: dependency-scanning, risk-assessment
- lifecycle_stage: pre-release
- dependencies: npm-check-updates, package-json
- provided_artifacts: dependency-graph, vulnerability-list
- summary: Analyze dependencies to achieve visibility into outdated and vulnerable packages.

- identifier: generate-compliance-report
- categories: compliance-reporting, legal-review
- lifecycle_stage: post-release
- dependencies: policy-docs, audit-log
- provided_artifacts: report-summary, flag-table
- summary: Generate a compliance report to ensure adherence to organizational licensing policies.
