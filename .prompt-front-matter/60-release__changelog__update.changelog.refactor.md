# Update CHANGELOG Template

Task: Given $1, produce a structured **metadata block** and then emit the original body unchanged. The metadata must expose identifiers, categories, optional lifecycle/stage, optional dependencies, optional provided artifacts, and a concise summary. Output = metadata, blank line, then $1.

## Inputs

- `since=tag` (optional): starting tag for change range (e.g., v1.4.2)
- `notes=include-prs` (optional): include PR numbers in output

## Canonical taxonomy (exact strings)

- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed
- Security

### Stage hints (for inference)

- generate: triggered by user input, produces static output
- process: data flow from source to structured result
- action: performs a specific operation on repository state

## Algorithm

1. Extract signals from $1
   - Titles/headings, imperative verbs, intent sentences, explicit tags, and dependency phrasing.

2. Determine the primary identifier
   - Prefer explicit input; otherwise infer from main action + object.
   - Normalize (lowercase, kebab-case, length-capped, starts with a letter).
   - De-duplicate.

3. Determine categories
   - Prefer explicit input; otherwise infer from verbs/headings vs canonical taxonomy.
   - Validate, sort deterministically, and de-dupe (≤3).

4. Determine lifecycle/stage (optional)
   - Prefer explicit input; otherwise map categories via stage hints.
   - Omit if uncertain.

5. Determine dependencies (optional)
   - Parse phrases implying order or prerequisites; keep id-shaped items (≤5).
   - Example: git describe, git log, merge commits.

6. Determine provided artifacts (optional)
   - Short list (≤3) of unlocked outputs.
   - Examples: Markdown snippet, unified diff, link references block.

7. Compose summary
   - One sentence (≤120 chars): “Do <verb> <object> to achieve <outcome>.”

8. Produce metadata in the requested format
   - Default to a human-readable serialization; honor any requested alternative.

9. Reconcile if input already contains metadata
   - Merge: explicit inputs > existing > inferred.
   - Validate lists; move unknowns to an extension field if needed.
   - Remove empty keys.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- Emit exactly one document: metadata, a single blank line, then $1.
- Limit distinct placeholders to ≤ 7.
- All content must be end-user focused — avoid internal file paths or refactor notes.
- No secrets or internal ticket links.
- If no Conventional Commits, infer section from message heuristics.

## Validation

- Identifier matches a normalized id pattern (e.g., update-changelog).
- Categories non-empty and drawn from canonical taxonomy (≤3).
- Stage, if present, is one of the allowed stages implied by stage hints.
- Dependencies, if present, are id-shaped (≤5).
- Provided artifacts ≤3 and match expected outputs.
- Summary ≤120 chars; punctuation coherent.
- Body text $1 is not altered.
